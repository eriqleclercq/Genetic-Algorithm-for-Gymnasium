# Using Genetic Algorithm to solve Farama's gymnasium

This is a very rough implementation that uses grid search for finding optimal hyper-parameters for the genetic algorithm. The neural network is expected to output continuous values instead of discrete ones.

`requirements.txt` contains all of the used packages to run this project.
